# Study of Linux list sorting

1. Read the designated paper "[Dude, is my code constant time?](https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/1123.pdf)".
2. Read the three papers listed in the commit [b5c56e](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/b5c56e0cdd62979dd538e5363b06be5bdf735a09) of `lib/list_sort.c`.
3. Present any insights, highlight and discuss the differences between the papers and the current Linux kernel source code.
4. Conduct the corresponding performance analysis experiments by refering to the CPython [listsort documentation](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/main/Objects/listsort.txt) to test different data distributions.
